# MAT File Variable Mappings
# ==========================
# This file defines how variables in your .mat file map to internal variable names.
# Edit this file to match YOUR .mat file's variable naming convention.
#
# Format: internal_name: "mat_file_variable_name"
#
# Example: If your .mat file uses 'x_pos' instead of 'N' for north position:
#   position:
#     north: "x_pos"

# Position variables (NED frame - North, East, Down)
position:
  north: "N"              # North position [meters]
  east: "E"               # East position [meters]
  down: "D"               # Down position [meters] (positive = below origin)

# Attitude variables (Euler angles)
attitude:
  roll: "phi"             # Roll angle (bank) [radians]
  pitch: "theta"          # Pitch angle [radians]
  yaw: "psi"              # Yaw/Heading angle [radians]

# Control surface deflections
controls:
  aileron: "delta_a"      # Aileron deflection [radians]
  elevator: "delta_e"     # Elevator deflection [radians]
  rudder: "delta_r"       # Rudder deflection [radians]

# Propulsion system (VTOL-specific)
propulsion:
  rpm_left: "RPM_Cl"      # Left cruise propeller RPM
  rpm_right: "RPM_Cr"     # Right cruise propeller RPM
  tilt_left: "theta_Cl"   # Left propeller tilt angle [radians]
  tilt_right: "theta_Cr"  # Right propeller tilt angle [radians]

# Metadata
metadata:
  sample_rate: "output_hz"  # Data sample rate [Hz]
  duration: "Time"          # Total simulation duration [seconds]

# Unit specifications
# These define the units used in your .mat file (for automatic conversion)
units:
  position: "meters"        # meters, feet
  attitude: "radians"       # radians, degrees
  controls: "radians"       # radians, degrees
  propulsion_rpm: "rpm"     # rpm
  propulsion_tilt: "radians"  # radians, degrees

# Optional: Additional custom variables
# Add any extra variables from your .mat file here
# custom:
#   my_variable: "mat_var_name"
