# Multi-Engine Configuration Example
# For aircraft like: Boeing 737, King Air, twin-engine jets/turboprops
#
# Copy this file to config/data_mapping.yaml and customize for your data

# Variable name mapping
position:
  north: "N"
  east: "E"
  down: "D"

attitude:
  roll: "phi"
  pitch: "theta"
  yaw: "psi"

controls:
  aileron: "delta_a"
  elevator: "delta_e"
  rudder: "delta_r"

# Propulsion configuration for twin-engine
propulsion:
  type: "multi_engine"

  units:
    - name: "left_engine"
      rpm_var: "N1_left"        # Left engine N1 percentage or RPM
      throttle_var: "thr_left"  # Optional: throttle position
      engine_index: 0           # X-Plane engine index
      rpm_max: 100              # If using N1%, max is 100

    - name: "right_engine"
      rpm_var: "N1_right"       # Right engine N1 percentage or RPM
      throttle_var: "thr_right"
      engine_index: 1
      rpm_max: 100

# For 4-engine aircraft (e.g., 747), add more units:
