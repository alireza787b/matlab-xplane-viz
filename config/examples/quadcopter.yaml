# Quadcopter Configuration Example
# For aircraft like: DJI-style quadcopters, research UAVs
#
# Copy this file to config/data_mapping.yaml and customize for your data

# Variable name mapping
position:
  north: "N"
  east: "E"
  down: "D"

attitude:
  roll: "phi"
  pitch: "theta"
  yaw: "psi"

# Quadcopters typically don't have traditional control surfaces
# These can be mapped to virtual/mixer outputs if available
controls:
  aileron: "roll_cmd"      # Or leave empty if not applicable
  elevator: "pitch_cmd"
  rudder: "yaw_cmd"

# Propulsion configuration for quadcopter (4 motors)
propulsion:
  type: "quadcopter"

  units:
    - name: "front_left"
      rpm_var: "motor1_rpm"   # Front-left motor RPM
      engine_index: 0
      rpm_max: 15000          # Typical for small quadcopter motors

    - name: "front_right"
      rpm_var: "motor2_rpm"
      engine_index: 1
      rpm_max: 15000

    - name: "rear_left"
      rpm_var: "motor3_rpm"
      engine_index: 2
      rpm_max: 15000

    - name: "rear_right"
      rpm_var: "motor4_rpm"
      engine_index: 3
      rpm_max: 15000

# For hexacopter or octocopter, add more units with appropriate indices

# Unit specifications
units:
  position: "meters"
  attitude: "radians"
  controls: "radians"
  propulsion_rpm: "rpm"

time:
  duration: "Time"
  sample_rate: "output_hz"

# Flight mode detection - could be based on altitude rate or commands
flight_modes:
  enabled: false
  # Optionally enable for hover/forward flight detection:
  # enabled: true
  # type: "speed_based"
  # thresholds:
  #   hover_max_speed: 2.0  # m/s
