# VTOL Tiltrotor Configuration Example
# For aircraft like: Alia-250, V-22 Osprey style tiltrotors
#
# Copy this file to config/data_mapping.yaml and customize for your data

# Variable name mapping - map YOUR .mat file variable names
position:
  north: "N"        # Your variable for North position (meters)
  east: "E"         # Your variable for East position (meters)
  down: "D"         # Your variable for Down position (meters, positive down)

attitude:
  roll: "phi"       # Roll angle (radians, positive right wing down)
  pitch: "theta"    # Pitch angle (radians, positive nose up)
  yaw: "psi"        # Yaw/heading angle (radians, positive clockwise from north)

controls:
  aileron: "delta_a"    # Aileron deflection (radians)
  elevator: "delta_e"   # Elevator deflection (radians)
  rudder: "delta_r"     # Rudder deflection (radians)

# Propulsion configuration for VTOL tiltrotor
propulsion:
  type: "vtol_tiltrotor"

  units:
    - name: "left"
      rpm_var: "RPM_Cl"       # Left motor RPM variable name
      tilt_var: "theta_Cl"    # Left motor tilt angle variable name
      engine_index: 1          # X-Plane engine index (may need adjustment per aircraft)
      rpm_max: 10000           # Maximum RPM for scaling (adjust to your aircraft)

    - name: "right"
      rpm_var: "RPM_Cr"       # Right motor RPM variable name
      tilt_var: "theta_Cr"    # Right motor tilt angle variable name
      engine_index: 0          # X-Plane engine index
      rpm_max: 10000

# Unit specifications
units:
  position: "meters"      # or "feet" - will convert to meters
  attitude: "radians"     # or "degrees" - will convert to radians
  controls: "radians"     # or "degrees"
  propulsion_tilt: "radians"  # Tilt angle units
  propulsion_rpm: "rpm"   # RPM units

# Time information
time:
  duration: "Time"        # Total simulation time variable name
  sample_rate: "output_hz"  # Sample rate variable name (Hz)

# Flight mode detection (VTOL-specific)
flight_modes:
  enabled: true
  type: "tilt_based"
  thresholds:
    cruise_max_tilt: 10   # Tilt angles below this = cruise mode (degrees)
    hover_min_tilt: 80    # Tilt angles above this = hover mode (degrees)
  labels:
    cruise: "CRUISE"
    hover: "HOVER"
    transition: "TRANSITION"
