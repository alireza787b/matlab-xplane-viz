# Fixed-Wing Single Engine Configuration Example
# For aircraft like: Cessna 172, Piper Cherokee, GA aircraft
#
# Copy this file to config/data_mapping.yaml and customize for your data

# Variable name mapping
position:
  north: "N"
  east: "E"
  down: "D"

attitude:
  roll: "phi"
  pitch: "theta"
  yaw: "psi"

controls:
  aileron: "delta_a"
  elevator: "delta_e"

# Propulsion configuration for single-engine fixed-wing
propulsion:
  type: "fixed_wing"

  units:
    - name: "main"
      rpm_var: "engine_rpm"     # Single engine RPM variable
      throttle_var: "throttle"  # Optional: throttle position (0-1)
